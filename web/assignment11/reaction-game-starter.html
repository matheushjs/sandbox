          <h3>A. Promises & async/await</h3>
          <p>
            Promises and async/await are artifices that supposedly make it easier for the programmer to expose and explore parallelism within the javascript application,
              which often results in an application that does not "hang", that is, does not become unresponsive from the user's perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
          They are not the only means to do that. One can also use <i>callbacks</i>, <i>setTimeout()</i> or <i>setInterval()</i>, but Promises and async/await can yield code that is more
              readable and less error prone.
            They are credited, for example, for preventing what is known as the <strong>callback hell</strong>, which is a code pattern that is very difficult to understand
              and read, and used to happen a lot before Promises came forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Promises and async/await are somewhat similar to each other, and may be used interchangeably.
            The developer should preferably choose the one that results either in shorter code or in a code that is more self-explanatory.
            An example of code that can better be expressed with async/await is as follows:
            <pre>
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  var num = await asyncFunc();
  doSomething(num);
}
...some other code</pre>
            which could be equivalently expressed with Promises as follows:
          <pre>
var prom = asyncFunc().then(num => doSomething(num));
for(var i = 1; i < 10; i++){
  prom = prom.then(asyncFunc());
  prom = prom.then(num => doSomething(num));
}
prom.then(...some other code);</pre>
            which is clearly more difficult to read.
          </p>
          <h3>B. What Changed in our Game?</h3>
          <p>
            The game is inherently sequential, and its only asynchronous portion is dealt with by the browser's built-in function <i>addEventListener</i>.
            In order to show how Promises and async/await work, we added a new functionality, unrelated to the game itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the game starts, the players are shown a message box with a button; as the players press the button, the messages change.
            The most interesting part is that <strong>the game does not stop</strong> even when the players are interacting with these message boxes.
            This was done using Promises and async/await.
            Furthermore, the code for showing each message box became as simple as:
            <pre>
async function asyncTest(){
  await showFact("In theory, promises make this easier...", 0, 0, "");
  await showFact("Oh, I guess they really do. Try one more time.", "", 0, 0);
  await showFact("Seems I can show you these messages without stopping the game.", 0, 0, "");
  await showFact("Awesome!", "", 0, 0);
}</pre>
            which is incredibly simpler (and easy to understand!!) than what we would be able to accomplish using <i>setTimeout</i>'s.
          </p>
          <p>
            We <strong>invite the reader</strong> to, after the game starts, keep the "S" button pressed while concurrently click on the message boxes' button :-).
          </p>
          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to Elf Reaction Game!
            In this game, you can test your reflexes against your opponent, using only one computer.
            Each player controls two sets of 4 keys on the keyboard: WASD and IJKL.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the "Start" button is pressed, the players are kept waiting for a random amount of time,
              after which the <strong>game suddenly starts</strong> and the players
              must <strong>follow the instructions</strong> given
              on the screen!
          </p>
          <p>
            The instructions are of the form "Press key K" or "Press key "W", and the player must press
              the corresponding key.
            The game ends after <strong>5 correct presses</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Rules</h3>
          <p>
          In case one of the players <strong>presses the wrong key</strong>, they will be <strong>penalized!</strong>
          The penalty is that the player's current score is decreased, so his
            <strong>progress is rewinded</strong> a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's it! Make sure to press keys as fast as you can, without pressing the wrong ones!
          </p>
          <h3>3. Game Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            We believe our version of the game is way more than 25% more complex than the original version :-).
            For a start, the original game's javascript code had 68 lines of code, and ours has 170.
            Winning the game requires multiple key presses, and players are penalized when they make a wrong
              move, which also contributes a lot to the complexity of the game.
