          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to Elf Reaction Game!
            In this game, you can test your reflexes against your opponent, using only one computer.
            Each player controls two sets of 4 keys on the keyboard: WASD and IJKL.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the "Start" button is pressed, the players are kept waiting for a random amount of time,
              after which the <strong>game suddenly starts</strong> and the players
              must <strong>follow the instructions</strong> given
              on the screen!
          </p>
          <p>
            The instructions are of the form "Press key K" or "Press key "W", and the player must press
              the corresponding key.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Rules</h3>
          <p>
          In case one of the players <strong>presses the wrong key</strong>, they will be <strong>penalized!</strong>
          The penalty is that the player's current score is decreased, so his
            <strong>progress is rewinded</strong> a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's it! Make sure to press keys as fast as you can, without pressing the wrong ones!
          </p>
          <h3>3. Game Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            We believe our version of the game is way more than 25% more complex than the original version :-).
            For a start, the original game's javascript code had 68 lines of code, and ours has 170.
            Winning the game requires multiple key presses, and players are penalized when they make a wrong
              move, which also contributes a lot to the complexity of the game.
